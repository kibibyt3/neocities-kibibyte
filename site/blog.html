		I've just started trying this out. At the moment this is more a proof of
		concept than anything else. All the same, I'll give it a shot.
		</p>
		<p>
		Today I spent a great deal of time working on quietude (you can find it
		on my github!). One mildly frustrating aspect of C that I'm still wrapping my head
		around is the way parameters and return values are treated in functions. As
		far as I can tell, function parameters never leave the function scope. For
		instance, in the case of the following:
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="tty_border">
	<div class="tty">
		void f(int x) {<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;x++;<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;return;<br>
		}<br>
	</div>
	</div>
		<p>
		the caller of <code>f()</code> never gets access to the incremented
		argument. This is a little confusing to me but it makes sense. It's
		consistent with the way C sees the world. This is where pointers come in!
		The documentation generator I use (i.e., <code>doxygen</code>) has an
		optional tag for unction parameters called <code>in</code> and
		<code>out</code>. As far as I can tell, the way this is thought of is that
		certain parameters (namely pointers) can have their contents altered. The
		specific address it points to will naturally never change, but the
		information stored at the address <i>can</i> be. In this way a parameter can
		be thought of as an <code>out</code> parameter if the information stored at
		the address changes, <i>even if the address itself never changes</i>.
		Despite how irritating this can be, it's a really elegant and pure approach
		to it all. The only way a function can ever alter anything in the line in
		which it's called is if a variable is defined as the return value of the
		function. When you give a function a parameter, you have absolute certainty
		that the specific variables will not be altered. And then in such cases as
		you want a parameter to be altered, you just supply the pointer. It's cool!

		In other news, I nabbed the neocities CLI. It works like a charm (even if
		the github repo that arch uses is dreadfully outdated and I had to spend
		more time than I can excuse tracking down its current version. (for those in
		a similar boat, get the package from ruby from your package manager and then
		run <code>gem install ruby</code>. don't forget to update your
		<code>PATH</code>!)). It's dreadfully elegant and there's even a post on the
		main neocities site that helps one set up a git hook that automatically
		pushes updates to neocities whenever <code>git push</code> is called.
		</p>
		<p>
		I think that'll be all for today. Bye &lt;3

		Memory is such a miserable thing. The concept of making sure that there's
		only ever one reference to a given piece of memory (or, naturally, otherwise
		heavily documenting exceptions to this rule) does certainly make sense!
		While working on Q today I was rewriting a bunch of stuff because I
		misunderstood <code>splint</code>'s <code>/*@shared@*/</code> annotation.
		Tragically it refers to proper garbage collection environments, which Q most
		certainly is not. This means I've had to purge this annotation from my
		program and (most especially) header files. Sad! Not of course that I don't
		appreciate this; already my stricter approach has helped me spot a potential
		memory leak that wasn't being handled properly. There's just so much work
		and learning that goes into it, I suppose.

		I got together with a new girl last night. Pretty awesome if you ask me.
		</p>
		<p>
		In other news! I finally finished making all of the Q modules manage their
		memory in a less leak-prone fashion. Exciting! There's just really so much
		thought that goes into it. Of course I was perhaps working at a disadvantage
		having not realised that a simple way to dispose of a reference is merely to
		reassign it to <code>NULL</code>. So it goes! With that under my toolbelt
		and a greater understanding of <code>splint</code>'s annotation system I'm
		in wonderful shape.
		</p>
		<p>
		Though really I am just awfully exciting to get back to work on the
		<code>qwalk</code> module. It's a module that's much more closer to the
		fundamental gameplay which is a very, very welcome reprieve from the
		abstracted-upon-abstracted nonsense I've hitherto had to put up with! It'll
		be the main meat of Q in that it's the section where you walk around. The
		plan is for this to comprise the plurality (if not majority) of gameplay, so
		I'm anxious to get it right but also eager to start on it in any case. All I
		hope is that I can depend on <code>qwalk</code>, <code>qattr</code>,
		<code>qfile</code>, and <code>mode</code> going forward. Doubtless I will
		have to tweak them in the future but I only hope that those tweaks are
		minimal. Or failing that that I at least get a break from larger-scale
		tweaks. They really kill me, you know! I so hunger to work on the meat of
		the game and see and feel more tangible results, rather than interfaces
		which interface with interfaces which interface with interfaces which
		interface with interfaces which interface with interfaces...
